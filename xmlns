<p>Bank rewards programs tied to credit or debit cards or other products can provide consumers with benefits such as points to be used for travel and shopping or cash back on purchases. But before jumping into any rewards program it's important to evaluate the potential costs and other important factors. The latest <em>FDIC Consumer News</em> features tips for maximizing the benefits and minimizing the mistakes when choosing a rewards program. The Summer 2015 edition also has articles on mobile financial services, automated teller machines (ATMs), credit scores, reverse mortgages, and deposit insurance. Here's an overview of what is in this issue.</p>
<p><strong>Tips on Choosing and Using Bank Rewards: </strong>These programs can offer enticing advantages, but consumers need to make sure they don't overlook the costs and conditions of the rewards or other account features. The newsletter suggests that consumers comparison shop different rewards programs, know exactly how rewards are earned, and choose an account that fits their lifestyle by rewarding them for purchases or deposits they would normally make even without the incentive.</p>
<p><strong>New Uses for Mobile Banking and Payments:</strong> Mobile financial services allow consumers to use their smartphone to make purchases without taking their credit or debit card out of their wallet, and to perform transactions that can include moving funds to another person's bank account. <em>FDIC Consumer News</em> offers a look at recent developments, including high-tech wristwatches that can be used to read messages from a bank or access basic services. The newsletter also offers safety tips, including the importance of protecting a mobile phone with a personal identification number (PIN) in case the device is lost or stolen.</p>
<p><strong>At the ATM &mdash; 10 Ways to Minimize Fees and Maximize Security:</strong> Many depositors who need cash turn to ATMs because of the convenience. But that convenience can come with costs. <em>FDIC Consumer News</em> suggests ways to keep ATM fees down, including a reminder that, under federal law, the fee that an operator of an ATM may charge for a withdrawal or other transaction must be disclosed on the screen of the machine or on a printout so that consumers can find another ATM if the fee is larger than expected. Other tips in the article cover security precautions.</p>
<p><strong>Establishing or Rebuilding Credit Scores &mdash; Options for Moving Forward:</strong> Credit scores, which are prepared by FICO and other companies, are mainly based on each person's history of managing debts. A credit score is an important factor used to determine whether you can access &mdash; or how much you pay for &mdash; a loan, credit card, apartment, or insurance. The article offers suggestions for consumers with damaged credit scores or no credit record.</p>
<p><strong>A Forward Look at Reverse Mortgages: </strong>These loans enable homeowners age 62 or older to borrow money from the equity in their home and not pay anything back until after the borrowers no longer live there. The newsletter reports on new federal rules that add protections for certain surviving spouses after the death of a reverse mortgage borrower, and a warning from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau about potentially misleading advertising. One of the main tips in the article is to talk to a qualified professional before deciding to get a reverse mortgage of any kind.</p>
<p><strong>More Answers to Consumer Questions About Deposit Insurance: </strong>FDIC staff answer more than 20,000 questions each year from depositors and bankers who ask about the deposit insurance rules to ensure that accounts are correctly structured and the money is fully insured. The latest issue provides answers to two commonly asked questions.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) today announced  significant new improvements to the deposit insurance education  materials available on the FDIC's website, <a href="http://www.fdic.gov?source=govdelivery&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery">www.fdic.gov</a>.   The enhancements are designed to improve the accessibility and  presentation of deposit insurance information for the general public  through organizational changes as well as through the expanded use of  explanatory videos and interactive infographics.  The changes are  designed to allow the public to quickly access basic information while  still offering the in-depth and comprehensive deposit insurance  information that has traditionally been available.  The FDIC will also  continue to offer the Electronic Deposit Insurance Estimator (EDIE),  where the public can enter their bank information to determine whether  their deposits are fully insured.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">FDIC Chairman Martin J. Gruenberg said, "Deposit insurance is a  foundation of public confidence in the banking system.  In over 80 years  of operation, the FDIC has never failed to live up to our promise of  protecting every penny of insured deposits.  Continuing to improve  public understanding about how deposit insurance works is fundamental to  carrying out this important mission."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The FDIC's new deposit insurance webpage can be found at <a href="http://www.fdic.gov/deposit/?source=govdelivery&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery">www.fdic.gov/deposit/</a>.</span></p>
